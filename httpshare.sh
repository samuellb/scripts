Listens on port 1111 and sends the given file to each HTTP client
that connects. The HTTP client can be, for example, a browser, or
a download utility such as curl or wget.

Note: This script is intended for transferring files over a firewalled
network (or a secure point-to-point network link). It does not offer any
security at all, and it does not handle concurrent users.
