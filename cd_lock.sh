For this command to work, you might have to configure udev first,
which can be done with the steps below (step might vary between systems):

  1. sudo cp /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  2. edit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules and remove (or comment out)
     DISK_EJECT_REQUEST
  3. save the file. the changes should take effect immediately

See the "eject" command for technical details.
