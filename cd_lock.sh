Locks (default) or unlocks the CD/DVD drive (or other ejectable drive).

The "lock" and "unlock" commands use the "eject" command internally. For
this to work, you might have to configure udev first, which can be done
with the steps below (step might vary between systems):

  1. sudo cp /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  2. edit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules and remove (or comment out)
     DISK_EJECT_REQUEST
  3. save the file. the changes should take effect immediately

As an alternative, you may also use the "hardlock" or "hardunlock"
subcommands, which use the /proc filesystem to lock the drive. This
typically requires root. cd_lock will attempt to use "sudo" to gain root,
if available.
